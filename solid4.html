  <h1>Solidification And Cooling</h1>
   <hr class="my-4">
   <h3>Solidification:</h3>
   <h5>Mechanism of solidification in Pure Metals:</h5>
  <p>Liquids need to be cooled below their freezing points before the solidification begins. This is because energy is required to create surfaces for new crystals. The degree of super cooling necessary is reduced by the presence of other surfaces which serve as the initial nuclei for the crystal growth. When a liquid metal is
  poured into a mould, initially the temperature everywhere is 80. The mould face itself acts as the nucleus for crystal growth, and if the conductivity of the mould is high, randomly- oriented small crystals grow near the mould face. Subsequently, a temperature gradient results within the casting, as indicated in fig. for t1 and t2 . As the solidification progresses gradually inwards, long columnar crystals, with their axes perpendicular to the mould face, grow. This orientation of crystal growth is desirable from the point of view of strength of casting.</p>
  
  <h5>Shrinkage:</h5>
  <p> The molten metal in the mold cavity occupies considerably more volume than the solidified castings that are eventually produced. This is for the compensation of volumetric contraction which metal exhibits. There are three quite different contractions to be dealt with when cooling from the liquid state to room temperature.</p>
  
  <h5>Liquid Contractions:</h5>
  <p> This contraction occurs while metal is cooling in liquid state, since liquid grows in density as it cools. This type of contraction in the liquid state does not pose a significant problem because most of the superheat of a melt is usually lost during or quickly after pouring. It is compensated by pouring more molten metal.</p>
  
  <h5> Solid Contraction:</h5>
  <p>The solid contraction occurs after the casting has solidified and as it cools from the solidification temperature to room temperature. To ensure that the dimensions of the castings are correct, the pattern used to produce the given casting is usually made slightly larger than the casting dimension.</p>
  
  <h5>Solidification Contraction:</h5>
  <p>Contraction during solidification occurs at the freezing point, since density of the solid is greater than density of liquid. This type of contraction is the root cause of solidification related defects which in turn causes shrinkage porosity or cavity. To compensate solidification contraction extra metal needs to be fed to the solidifying casting. This extra metal is provided by separate reservoir of metal  called as feeder, since  its action is to feed the metal to casting.</p>

  <h3>Solidification Simulation</h3>
  <p> The solidification process involves the transformation of the hot liquid metal to solid and then subsequent cooling of the solid to the room temperature. Solidification  of  molten metal after being poured into a mold cavity is an important phase in the casting process which greatly affects the product quality and yield. During the past two decades, computer modeling of solidification simulation has been widely used in foundry with an aim to:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> Predict the pattern of solidification, including shrinkage cavities and associated defect predictions for various ferrous metals like steel, grey iron, ductile iron and nonferrous metals like aluminium, copper, etc. as well as in precious metals like gold, silver,etc.</li>
  <li> Simulate solidification in various orientation of casting, with various metal-process combinations, so that optimal position can be selected.</li> 
  </ul>
  <p> Such simulation can be obtained in Efoundry, developed by a team of faculty members under Dr.B.Raviâ€™s supervision at IIT-Bombay. It gives an approximate visualization of the solidification in a given casting. This can be used to know how efficient a designed feeder will work so as to reduce the number of experimental trials</p>
  
  
  <hr class="my-4">
  <h3> Cooling:</h3>
  <p>A chill is a material or component of high thermal conductivity used to accelerate the cooling of the metal in the mould. Chills can be made of copper or cast iron, the latter is more usual. The chill is set into the face of the mould, against the pattern surface. The surface of the chill is painted with spirit-based shellac to prevent oxidization. A densener is inserted into the mould or core face, or protrudes into the mould cavity, to promote localized solidification. Denseners are surrounded by molten metal during pouring. Made of the same metal as the product, they are fused into the casting sections and are not recoverable.</p>
